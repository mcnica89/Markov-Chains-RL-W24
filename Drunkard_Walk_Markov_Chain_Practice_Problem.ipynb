They start at some position $x_{init} \\in \\{0,1,\\ldots,n\\}$ and at each time step they either step forward (toward their house) by one unit, advacing their position from $x$ to $x+1$, or step backwards by one unit (towards the police station) by one unit, going from position $x$ to $x-1$. Both directions are equally likely. If they ever reach the house at $x=n$, they go inside and stop walking. If they ever reach the police station at $x=0$, they are arrested and  stop walking.\n",
