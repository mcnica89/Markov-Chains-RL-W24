        "In this problem, instead of betting until something happens, the gambler will bet for a fixed number of rounds $t_{max}$. On each round they must bet at least $\\$ 1$, and can bet any amount up to and including their entire bankroll. (Exception: if they ever get to a bankroll of $x=\\$0$ they are broke and they stay broke for all rounds.)\n",

The player can never gamble with funds from the savings account, but is rewarded for these saving account dollars as regular dollars. *Example:* If $p_{win}=100\\%$, then the optimal strategy is to always bet the maximum amount. When the table maximum is $n_{max} = 7$, then the value of $t=2$ and $x=\\$5$ is ```v[2,5]=17``` because their  bets will proceed as follows:\n",
