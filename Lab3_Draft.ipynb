        "# Q2 Easy 21 With A Finite Deck And Card Counting - Warm Up for the Final Project\n",
        "\n",
        "Rules of the game:\n",
        "- A \"shoe\" is a large stack of cards that consists of multiple decks of cards shuffled toghether. In Easy21 with a finite deck, we create a shoe of cards by combining together *10* ordinary decks. Cards are dealt from the shoe *without replacement* (i.e. once a card is dealt out, it is gone!)\n",
        "- An \"episode\" now consits of a full play through one shoe of the deck and consists of multiple hands played back to back with the player's bankroll going up/down as hands are played.\n",
        " - The player starts with a bankroll of $100.\n",
        " - The player can choose their bet size before each hand, which is paid out at even odds (i.e. they either win this amount, or lose this amount depending on if they win/lose the hand.) This is the function \"playerBetSizeChoice\".\n",
        "- In each hand, The dealer/player take turns using a player strategy function \"playerActionIsHit\". (e.g. in Lab 2 Q1b, you computed the optimal strategy in the infinite deck case) The dealer always follows the hit-below-17 strategy.\n",
        " - As they play, cards are consumed from the shoe.\n",
        "- If at anytime the cards completely run out, no more hitting is allowed. (i.e. the player or dealer is forced to \"stick\")\n",
        "  - A new hand is only dealt out if there is at least one full deck of cards remaining in the shoe (30 cards). Otherwise the episode is over and no more hands are dealt.\n",
        "- The player is allowed to do \"card counting\"\n",
        "  - The player is allowed to write down one integer (sometimes called \"the count\") which they can rememeber and keep track of from hand to hand.\n",
        "  - The count is updated using \"playerCardCounterUpdate\" function which inputs the old count, the next observed card, the number of cards left in the deck and returns the NEW count.\n",
        "  - All of the players choices are allowed to depend on the count (for example, the count could be used to signal when to bet big or bet small)\n",
        "\n",
        "  In Lab 3, you will do the following:\n",
        "  - The playerActionIsHit will be taken to be the value from Lab2 in the function Lab2Actions (for the final project you will be free to change this however you want)\n",
        "  - The bet size will always be 1\n",
        "  - **Q2a** Write a card counter update function so that the count always represetns the average value of the cards in the shoe. Submit the counter update function.\n",
        "  - **Q2b** Use a Monte Carlo or TD learning method to estimate the probability of winning a hand GIVEN the current average value of the shoe, before the cards are dealt out.\n",
        "   - Implementation details:\n",
        "     - To make the average value of the shoe fit (which is a float) fit into the table of values for the state, we will ROUND THE AVERAGE to the nearest tenth, and work in units of \"tenths of a point\" e.g. if the average is 0.183333 we will round it to 0.2, and keep this as the integer \"2\" for our table.\n",
        "     - To deal with negative values, we will add +100 to everything e.g. if the average is -0.5, we will convert this to -5 (working in tenths), and then add +100 to it to put it into our table at index 95. (Note that the most negative possible average, an average of -10.0, gets mapped to index 0 by this formula)\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Fun Fact: A solution to Q2b combined with a solution to Q1 gives you a method to create a good betting strategy for the final project! This is one possible strategy you can use for the final project.\n",
        "  - Submit both the code that you used to do this, and an array which is your final answer.\n",
