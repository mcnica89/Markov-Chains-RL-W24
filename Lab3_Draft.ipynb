The player gets to see the value of $p$ before they choose their bet size. All the other details like $n_{max}$,$t_{max}$, the savings account etc are exactly the same.

        "Rules of the game:\n",
        "- A \"shoe\" is a large stack of cards that consists of multiple decks of cards shuffled toghether. In Easy21 with a finite deck, we create a shoe of cards by combining together *10* ordinary decks. Cards are dealt from the shoe *without replacement* (i.e. once a card is dealt out, it is gone!)\n",
        "- An \"episode\" now consits of a full play through one shoe of the deck and consists of multiple hands played back to back with the player's bankroll going up/down as hands are played.\n",
        " - The player starts with a bankroll of $100.\n",
        " - The player can choose their bet size before each hand, which is paid out at even odds (i.e. they either win this amount, or lose this amount depending on if they win/lose the hand.) This is the function \"playerBetSizeChoice\".\n",
        "- In each hand, The dealer/player take turns using a player strategy function \"playerActionIsHit\". (e.g. in Lab 2 Q1b, you computed the optimal strategy in the infinite deck case) The dealer always follows the hit-below-17 strategy.\n",
        " - As they play, cards are consumed from the shoe.\n",
        "- If at anytime the cards completely run out, no more hitting is allowed. (i.e. the player or dealer is forced to \"stick\")\n",
        "  - A new hand is only dealt out if there is at least one full deck of cards remaining in the shoe (30 cards). Otherwise the episode is over and no more hands are dealt.\n",
        "- The player is allowed to do \"card counting\"\n",
        "  - The player is allowed to write down one integer (sometimes called \"the count\") which they can rememeber and keep track of from hand to hand.\n",
        "  - The count is updated using \"playerCardCounterUpdate\" function which inputs the old count, the next observed card, the number of cards left in the deck and returns the NEW count.\n",
        "  - All of the players choices are allowed to depend on the count (for example, the count could be used to signal when to bet big or bet small)\n",
        "\n",
        "  In Lab 3, you will do the following:\n",
        "  - The playerActionIsHit will be taken to be the value from Lab2 in the function Lab2Actions (for the final project you will be free to change this however you want)\n",
        "  - The bet size will always be 1\n",
        "  - **Q2a** Write a card counter update function so that the count always represetns the average value of the cards in the shoe.\n",
        "  - **Q2b** Use a Monte Carlo or TD learning method to estimate the probability of winning a hand GIVEN the current average value of the shoe.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Note: A solution to Q2b combined with a solution to Q1 gives you a method to create a good betting strategy for the final project!\n",
